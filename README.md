# MIRACL Core

MIRACL Core is an extended re-released version of the original Apache Milagro
Cryptographic Library (AMCL).

> MIRACL Core is a multi-lingual and architecturally agnostic Cryptographic library
> that supports elliptic curve cryptography, pairing-friendly curve cryptography,
> RSA, AES symmetric encryption and hash functions. All code is entirely in the
> supported high-level languages. No assembly language and no third party code
> is required - these libraries are completely self- contained. MIRACL Core was
> designed from the ground up with side-channel attack resistance in mind.
> Multiple curves can be supported in a single application.
